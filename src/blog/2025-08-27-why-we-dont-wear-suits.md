# Why We Don’t Wear Suits (And Other Things That Make Us Different)

When people think of “professional,” the image that comes to mind is often polished shoes, crisp ties, and boardroom formality. But here’s the thing: professionalism isn’t defined by a suit—it’s defined by the work, the values, and the way people show up every day.

We don’t wear suits, and that’s just one of the ways we’ve chosen to do things differently. Here’s why.

### 1. Comfort Fuels Creativity

Suits look sharp, but they’re not exactly comfortable for long hours of collaboration and problem-solving. We believe when people are at ease—whether in jeans, a t-shirt, or sneakers—they bring their best ideas to the table. Comfort gives space for focus, creativity, and flow.

### 2. Work Over Wardrobe

Our clients don’t hire us for our clothing choices—they hire us for results. By dropping the stiff dress code, we put the spotlight where it belongs: on delivering excellent work, not on which tie matches the blazer.


### 3. Authenticity Matters

Wearing what feels natural helps us stay authentic. We’d rather you see *us*—our personalities, quirks, and genuine energy—than a uniform that doesn’t reflect who we are. Authenticity builds trust, and trust is the foundation of every great partnership.

### 4. Flat, Not Hierarchical

A lot of traditional dress codes reinforce hierarchy—“the higher up you are, the sharper the suit.” That’s not how we operate. We work as a team, side by side. No one needs a power tie to prove their voice matters here.


### 5. It’s About Culture, Not Clothes

The “no suits” choice is symbolic of something bigger: we’re building a culture where freedom, flexibility, and fresh ideas thrive. Whether that’s through the way we dress, the way we work, or the way we interact with clients, we’re committed to keeping things refreshingly human.


### Final Thought

We’re not saying suits are bad—they’re just not *us.* What sets us apart isn’t just what we wear, but how we think, collaborate, and create. By doing things differently, we stay true to our values and to the people we work with.
