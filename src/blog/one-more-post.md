description: This is just a test post made from gh, we're trying this one without a date in the filename.

This post file does not have a date in the filename. It does have a date in the post metadata.
Let's see how this works.

There is nothing more to it. But while we're at it, I will also see how I can create a table in this post.

Here is a table.

| Sr no. | Name | Date of Birth |
|--------|------|---------------|
|1|Kamal|31-02-1980|
|2|Joe|16-06-1986|

How about adding an image straight from the github UI to see if that works. This is not the best practice, but it should work.

And, it works!
